# Barbato_Workshops

The goal of this assignment was to create a checkout menu for different job training sessions and the associated cost for the chosen training and location. We had to make sure a user could not add a session to the cart without selecting both the training and location. The calculate total button and reset button had to be disabled until there was at least one item in the cart.
